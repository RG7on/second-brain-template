You are running the brain's consolidation pass. You are on a consolidate/
branch — never touch main. Read CLAUDE.md first and follow it exactly; its
"What earns a note" section is the bar for every judgement call below.

Do these in order, respecting every cap:

1. Drain the inbox: for each note in knowledge/inbox/ (oldest first, max 20),
   decide where it belongs — a new canonical note (create via the conventions:
   proper frontmatter, aliases, topics from topics.yaml) or a merge into an
   existing note. Then delete the inbox file. If an item is not actionable
   knowledge (noise), delete it and note that in the commit message.
2. Promote from the journal: skim journal entries newer than the last
   consolidate commit for durable facts worth a canonical note. Promote at
   most 5; leave the journal entries themselves untouched.
3. Mine recent sessions — skip this step entirely if .cache/session-digest.md
   does not exist. That file holds the user's OWN prompts from the past week's
   Claude sessions. It is raw material, never knowledge: they were thinking out
   loud, not dictating notes, and much of it is already stale.
   Propose at most 7 items they would otherwise lose — decisions and the
   reasoning behind them, stated preferences and constraints, facts about their
   world, answers that cost real effort. Search the brain first and skip
   anything already recorded; skip everything on the policy's never-capture
   list. When in doubt, leave it out — a missed item comes back around, a
   wrong one gets believed.
   Write each survivor as an inbox note (frontmatter `created:` + `status:
   draft`), body opening with:
   `PROPOSED from session mining — <session date>. Verify before promoting.`
   These are proposals for the user, so do NOT promote them to canonical notes in
   this same pass — they wait in the inbox for the user to keep or kill.
   SENSITIVE MATERIAL — if a candidate touches a named person's private life,
   health, finances or relationships, do NOT write the content anywhere. Write
   only `Ask about <subject> — <session date> session.` This branch is
   pushed to GitHub; details belong in vault/, added by hand, or nowhere.
4. Review debt: list notes whose review_by is past. For the 5 oldest, verify
   the content still holds; update the note and bump review_by, or supersede
   it if the fact changed.
5. Contradiction check: for every note you created or merged, search
   (bin/brain search + rg) for existing notes on the same subject. If two
   current notes disagree, resolve via the supersede protocol in CLAUDE.md.
   Proposals from step 3 are exempt — they are not knowledge yet.
6. Enrich: add missing aliases to any note you touched.

Hard caps: modify at most 15 canonical files total, plus at most 7 new inbox
proposals from step 3. If the inbox has more than 20 items, process the oldest
20 and stop — the rest wait for next week.

Finish: run bin/brain lint and fix every error until it exits clean. Commit
everything as "consolidate: <today's date>" with a body listing what was
drained, promoted, proposed, reviewed, and superseded. Do not push, do not
merge, do not switch branches.
